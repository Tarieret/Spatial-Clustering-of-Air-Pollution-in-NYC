# Spatial-Clustering-of-Air-Pollution-in-NYC
This repository contains the code and analysis for a research project investigating the spatial distribution of air pollutants (PM2.5 and NO2) in New York City. K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms were used to identify distinct clusters and evaluate areas with high pollutant concentrations.

Key Findings:

Identified three distinct clusters of air quality in NYC.

Revealed areas with disproportionately high PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations.

Demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of K-means and hierarchical clustering for environmental data analysis.
