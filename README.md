# Spatial-Clustering-of-Air-Pollution-in-NYC
his repository contains the code and analysis for a project that explores the spatial clustering of air pollution in New York City. I utilized annual average data for PM2.5 and NO2 levels. The project compares the performance of K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms in identifying distinct air quality zones within the city.
